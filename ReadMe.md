# üìê unitlib

- Physical units for NumPy arrays.
- Fast, simple, high voltage ‚ö°



## Why

`unitlib` was born out of frustration with other Python unit packages.
Those packages work well for toy experiments, but they greatly slow down your code.
This makes their use unfeasible for even moderate scale scientific simulations.



## Installation

```
$ pip install unitlib
```
This will get you the

`unitlib` is tested on Python versions 3.9 down to 3.6, on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

(This only pertains to development code. The `unitlib` versions on PyPI
pass all tests on release, of course).
