# yunit üìê

Physical units for NumPy arrays.\
Fast ‚Ä¢ Simple ‚Ä¢ High voltage


## Speed

This package was born out of frustration with other Python unit packages. Existing
packages work well for toy experiments, but they greatly slow down your code. This
makes their use unfeasible for even moderate scale scientific simulations.




## Installation

```
$ pip install yunit
```
This will get you the
